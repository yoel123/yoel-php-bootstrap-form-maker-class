a php bootstrap form generation class<br>

i created it to make it easier for me to generate and maintain bootstrap forms, without a lot of messy html code.<br>
anything from add forms to edit or login forms etc.

i created it for personal use, i needed my own form maker php class. for my templates etc.<br>
if it helpful for you use it, i commented alot, it shod be very simple to use.
